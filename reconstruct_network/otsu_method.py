"otsu_method.py" : Calculates optimal mode seperating threshold for samples arising from a bimodal 
distribution that maximises the inter-mode variance according to Otsu method
[Nobuyuki Otsu (1979). "A threshold selection method from gray-level histograms".
 IEEE Trans. Sys., Man., Cyber. 9 (1): 62â€“66.]

Input
----------
>>> "X" : samples from bimodal distribution 

Output
----------
>>> "threshold": optimal threshold that seperates the 2 distributions according to Otsu method

Accompanying material to "Inferring network connectivity from event timing
patterns".
