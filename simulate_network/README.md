**simulation.py** generates time series of randomly-connected networks of excitatory
and inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons interacting through delta synapses.
Generates the following output files:

- **"Data/delay.dat"** :  Contains the synaptic delay employed in the simulations

- **"Data/ex_neurons"** : Contains the corresponding spiking times of excitatory neurons

- **"Data/in_neurons"** : Contains the corresponding spiking times of inhibitory neurons

- **"Data/connectivity.dat"** :  Contains the connecitivy matrix used in the simulation
